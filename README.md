# DevOps Machine (Docker)

## 1. Installing the tools

##### 1.1 - first you need to install Homebrew and Cask, you can do so by running following commands in sequence 

```
make brew
```
##### 1.2 - then you need to install virtualbox, since our docker's setup relies on a virtual machine that is poweredby virtualbox,

if you have it installed you can skip this step otherwise open up your terminal and run this command:

```
brew cask install virtualbox
```

##### 1.3 then install docker and its tools

if you have it installed you can skip this step otherwise  run this command:

```
brew install docker docker-compose docker-machine
```

##### 1.4 then install docker credentials helper 
if you have it installed you can skip this step otherwise run this command:

```
brew install docker-credential-helper
```

## 2- Prepare the workspace:

```
